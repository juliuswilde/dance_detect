# Dance Detect

## What is this?

This will hopefully some day be a tool to tell you which style you can dance to a given song.
I would also like to add some general audio analysis like BPM or similar stuff.

## Why does it exist?

Mainly for fun and to learn some more stuff about programming.

I want to learn a different programming language besides python and want to dome some graphical programming.
Thats why I decided to do a full-stack developement project.
I also love to dance and thought some people could benefit from having a tool tell them what dance they could dance to a song.

## Roadmap

1. Follow the Odin Project (TOP) Foundations Course
    1. Create a real basic plain HTML-Page
    2. Style the page a bit using the CSS-part of TOP
    3. Do some basic stuff to learn JavaScript
2. Flesh out the front-end with the TOP Full-Stack JavaScript Course
    1. Add Interactivity
    2. Probably redo the basic App with react
3. Full-Stack
    1. I'll probably switch to TypeScript here and rework the App
    2. Create a basic Python-API for the backend
4. Detection
    1. Create Spectrography of Audio-Data (Mic)
    2. Train an Image-Classification-Model to classify the appropriate Dance-Style
    3. Add some more features for fun
5. (Porting)
    1. If im still interested in this project: create Android Port (maybe Kotlin)
    2. Create IOS-Port
