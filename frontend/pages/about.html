        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is just a little side project to learn a bit of full-stack web-developement.
            The idea is to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>.
            After that i will probably switch to TypeScript + React for the front-end part.
            The back-end will be done using Python.
